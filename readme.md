## Instructions

Here are the instructions:

- [x] 1. Download the template.html from the 'files' folder
- [x] 2. Place a button on the section with the commentary, give it the 'btn' & 'btn-primary' classes, the button should read 'Calculate!'.
- [x] 3. Save the button in a variable & log it in the console
- [x] 4. Log "Clicky!", when you click the button
- [x] 5. When you click the button switch the 'btn-primary' class to 'btn-success'
- [x] 6. After 0.5 seconds; switch the 'btn-success' class back to 'btn-primary'
- [x] 7. When you click the button, add the fontawese loading icon to the front of the button's content, make sure it spins as well.
- [x] 8. After .5 seconds it needs to disappear as well.
- [x] 9. When you click the button; the text needs to change to 'Calculating ...'
- [x] 10. After .5 seconds it goes back to 'Calculate!'. Make sure the fontawsome icon still works
- [x] 11. Add an input field to the left of the button, make it a text input
- [x] 12. Add a div with a nice border below the button (make sure to add some top margin to the div so it's nice and separate)
- [x] 13. When you click the button; after .5 seconds, the inputted number (from the input field) gets printed in the bordered div box
- [x] 14. Now make sure when you print the number in the box, that there is a message saying 'Here is your result:' '$x' where '$x' is the number
- [x] 15. Now make sure you don't add this text with javascript
- [x] 16. Add a second (text) input field, to the right of the first input field, move the button one line below the two input fields
- [x] 17. When you click the button, both numbers of the input fields should be added to each other
- [x] 18. If one of the input fields is empty, then use javascript to block the result from being calculated
- [x] 19. Display an error message on top of the input fields, saying what the problem is
- [x] 20. Now remove that code and add the `required` attribute to the input html tags, compare both results
- [x] 21. Add a select element in between the input fields (so it's input, select, input and then button below these)
- [x] 22. The select value should have all operators as options
- [ ] 23. Now when you click the button, it should calculate the operation (add when + is selected, remove when - is selected, ...)
- [ ] 24. Catch the following error: `You can't divide by 0`
- [ ] 25. Catch the following error: `You can't subtract a number from a smaller number (5-23)`
- [ ] 26. Catch the following error: `You can't divide by a number if the result would not be an integer`
- [ ] 27. Catch the following error: `You can't multiply by odd numbers`
- [ ] 28. If the text `rand` is entered instead of a number, then on key up change that text to a random number (integer) between 0-100
- [ ] 29. Catch the following error: `You can't do any operations if the content is anything but a number`
- [ ] 30. If you type `Boom!` in any of the input fields, the entire page content (separately) falls down out of the page and you are left with a blank page

## Bonus

- [ ] 31. We had a lot of fun with this excercise and we decided to rebuild the page after it felt down
- [ ] 32. We added a reload button with counter on the page!
